# Problem Illustration
Given a sequence of data-points, we must predict what comes next.

# Problem Formalization
Let us look at how we formalize this problem with some notations.

# Prediction Accuracy
It is important to calculate how well your model is doing by messauring the error.
Several specific ways can be used with the most common being MAPE(Mean Absolute Prediction Error) and MSPE(Mean Square Prediction Error).

# Landscape of forecasting models
We can divide these models into 2 broad types - linear and non-linear. 
Linear model comprise of techniques like auto-regression while neural network based approaches make up non-linear methods.

* LASSO - Form of penalized regression. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
* RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks
* LSTM - Long-Short Term Memory Networks.
* GRU - Gate Recurrent Unit

# RNN vs Feed-Forward networks
RNN use information from the previous interation in the current iteration. Loop for the cyclic connections.
